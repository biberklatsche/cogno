# Motivation

I am a developer. For me the most powerful help is autocomplete. I want to have something like that in my terminal. So let's build one.

# Features

**Smart autocompletion** 

    Cogno includes context-sensitive autocompletion based on your previously used commands.

**Tabs and Panes**

    Cogno supports tabs and freely rearrangeable split panes.

**Workspaces**

    You can save tabs and panes arrangements as workspaces and restore them with just one click.

**Easy to style.**

    Style the Terminal simply by editing a json-file or use themes from terminal.sexy.

**Configurable shortcuts**

    You can change the existing shortcuts or even better - put a command on a shortcut.

**Different shells**
    
    Cogno supports GitBash, Powershell and Bash for Windows (at the moment).

**Paste history**

    If you need to paste something again, you will find it in your paste history.
